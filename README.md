# joined_structures
To read all, current and old, structure_xxx.xml files for all sites, and grab from there sn, mac, location, etc
And save it into separate file, for future processing into db, as to have history of site+location , ch/gw/ed info 
(it changes as unit moves from site to site, gets repaired and refurbished, and recommissioned again).
